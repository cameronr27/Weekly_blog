The first week of CIT 480 was an interesting experience from outside of the class and inside. The class was made into separate focus groups to develop real-life projects that would be of use outside of the classroom setting into the real world. With every group consisting of a mix of CIT and COMPSCI majors, communication skills were definitely something more noticeable than any other time, I feel this was very helpful for not only myself but the entire class, it helps us grasp an understanding to what is coming once school is over, mainly on how to analyze various situations with new team members.

Outside of the class we were responsible for Installing docker, Jekyll/Hugo, and an ssh client. Using Jekyll and docker was something new for me and took a while to grasp an understanding of them. Once downloaded I used tutorials to help me firmly understand them and how to do the required assignments and learn basic syntaxes of them. This was pretty frustrating but needed, it is the first week of school and this is only preparing for what is to come.

With the mixture of different types of student majors in every group, there was many great projects explained with great detail, we had to consolidate ideas we all had in mind to one, we would all agree upon this and work towards it. Our team came up with a plan to design a queue system for CSUN that would handle the long lines in buildings that offer services such as financial aid and admissions. We would go into detail on how to deploy this application, pros and cons would be discussed, how it would be used, where it would be accessed from, and how to design it. Storyboarding this idea was not only difficult because of how concise everything needed to be, it was also fun, everyone on this team has a passion when it comes to computers and how it can benefit others, so discussion was easy and educational for the team.
